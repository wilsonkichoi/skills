# wkc-implement validation

Follow [Validation](../AGENTS.md#validation): select affected cases and harnesses, use direct checks first, and reuse unchanged evidence.
This is a case catalog, not a full test sequence for each change.
Record PASS, FAIL, or SKIP for selected cases. Keep direct checks separate from harness behavior.
Keep raw logs and fixtures outside tracked files.

## Preparation

Export a clean candidate tree with `git archive`, because local installation copies ignored files too. Install
`wkc-implement`, `wkc-tracker`, and `wkc-backlog` from it into each fixture with
`npx skills add "<clean-candidate>" -s wkc-implement -s wkc-tracker -s wkc-backlog -a claude-code -y`, and record
`npx skills --version`.

Fixtures that write tickets or pull requests use throwaway repositories, never this one (ROADMAP). Each is a
one-file bash CLI, `greet`, with `./test.sh` as `test_command`, an approved PRD, SPEC, and ROADMAP, and the installed
skill directories gitignored.

- **GitHub fixture.** `issue_tracker: github`, the four status labels, and one ticket per case. Stage the finish
  cases by hand: a merged pull request whose body starts `Refs #N`, the ticket `in-review` and held by the caller, and
  a handoff comment from the SPEC template. A ticket with `## After merge` steps covers each finish branch: a
  runnable check, a `(needs authorization)` release, a check the merged code fails, and a check that already failed
  once and has a merged follow-up that did not fix it. Another holder's open pull request comes from a
  `workflow_dispatch` workflow, so its author is `app/github-actions`.
- **Local fixture.** `issue_tracker: local`, a GitHub remote for pull requests, a `ready` ticket, an `in-progress`
  ticket held by `Alice Dev`, and a ticket that needs a SPEC component no ticket delivers. Score ticket files with a
  YAML parser.
- **Linear fixture.** `issue_tracker: linear` against a sandbox team and a throwaway project, with a GitHub remote.

Each AI session reads the installed `SKILL.md` and follows it; questions end its turn and the tester answers.
Score every case from `gh issue view`, `gh pr view`, `git`, the ticket files, or the Linear MCP server, never from the
session's report.

## Cases

1. **Package.** Direct. Parse the frontmatter and `agents/openai.yaml` with a YAML parser.
   PASS: `disable-model-invocation: false`, `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: true`, the five opening fields in
   order, callers named as people, `wkc-yolo`, and a model acting on a person's request, the sentence that it never
   starts `wkc-code-review`, `description` on one line, and `wc -l SKILL.md` under 250. Installed copy identical to
   the source by `diff -r`.

2. **Templates.** Direct. Extract the fenced block that follows each template's lead-in from `SKILL.md` and from SPEC
   Contracts: the PR body, the handoff, gate, and finish comments, and the `Discovered:` line.
   PASS: `diff` of each pair gives no output, and no extracted block is empty.

3. **Build.** On a `ready` ticket with a criterion whose tool is missing, and a main checkout with a tracked change,
   an untracked file, and an ignored file: `wkc-implement <N>`.
   PASS: `gh issue view` shows the caller as assignee and `in-review`, with exactly one handoff comment naming the PR
   URL and its full head sha. `gh pr view` shows the PR `OPEN`, no labels, a body starting `Refs #<N>`, each criterion
   with its command and result, and the missing tool's criterion unchecked with the reason. `shasum` of the three
   dirty files is unchanged.

4. **Rerun on a complete handoff.** Run case 3's ticket again.
   PASS: the reply reports the review state, and the issue's labels, assignees, and comments and the PR's body,
   labels, and state hash the same before and after.

5. **Rerun after a cut-short handoff.** Stage a ticket `in-progress`, held by the caller, with an open PR whose body
   starts `Refs #<N>` and no handoff comment. Run it.
   PASS: no new PR or branch; exactly one handoff comment naming that PR and its head; `in-review`; the assignee is
   unchanged.

6. **No argument.** With merged `in-review` tickets held by the caller and a `ready` frontier: `wkc-implement`.
   PASS: the reply names the merged `in-review` tickets before the frontier, ends on a numbered question, and the
   fixture's issues and PRs are unchanged.

7. **Eligibility.** Name a `ready`, unassigned ticket with another author's open PR; on the local fixture, name the
   ticket held by `Alice Dev`.
   PASS: each reply names the PR or the holder, and no issue, ticket file, PR, or branch changes; no other ticket is
   claimed.

8. **Uncommitted planning document.** Change `spec_file` without committing it, then name a `ready` ticket.
   PASS: the reply stops on a question that offers to work in the current checkout; `git branch -a` and the ticket
   are unchanged.

9. **Finish without a gate.** Merge case 3's PR as the person, then run it.
   PASS: one finish comment `wkc-implement: done` naming the PR and merge commit, and the ticket `done` (`CLOSED`,
   `COMPLETED`).

10. **Finish with a runnable gate.** Run the staged ticket with a runnable `## After merge` check.
    PASS: one gate comment naming the merge commit with `Result: pass`, a finish comment `done`, the ticket `done`,
    and its timeline shows `in-progress` before the close.

11. **Unauthorized step.** Run the staged release ticket, whose step ends `(needs authorization)`, without
    authorizing it.
    PASS: the gate comment says `not run`; the finish comment `waiting` names the step and who must act; the ticket is
    `in-progress`; `git ls-remote --tags origin` shows no new tag; the turn ends on a question.

12. **Follow-up PR.** Run the staged ticket whose merged code fails its gate.
    PASS: a gate comment with `Result: fail`; a finish comment `follow-up`; a new PR from the current `main` whose
    body starts `Refs #<N>` and has the follow-up line naming the merged PR; a handoff naming the new PR; the ticket
    `in-review`.

13. **Same gate fails again.** Run the staged ticket whose follow-up merged without fixing the gate.
    PASS: a gate comment with `Result: fail` against the new merge commit; a finish comment `waiting`; the ticket
    `in-progress`; no new PR.

14. **Discovered work at handoff.** On the local fixture, build the `ready` ticket after telling the session about an
    out-of-scope defect, and nothing else.
    PASS: the ticket file gains a `Discovered:` comment in the SPEC template with `Blocks this ticket: no`; the PR body
    starts with the ticket path; the handoff lands; the session then follows `wkc-backlog` without being asked and its
    last turn is `wkc-backlog`'s approval question; no ticket file is created before an answer.

15. **Discovered blocker.** On the local fixture, run the ticket that needs a missing SPEC component.
    PASS: a `Discovered:` comment with `Blocks this ticket: yes`; `wkc-backlog` runs before any PR; no PR exists for the
    ticket; the ticket keeps its status and holder.

16. **No GitHub remote.** On a copy of the local fixture with no remote, build a `ready` ticket.
    PASS: the reply says it stopped at a local branch; the branch exists with a commit; the ticket is `in-progress`.

17. **Linear reference.** On the Linear fixture, build the `Todo` issue.
    PASS: the PR body starts `Related to <ID> <URL>`; neither the branch name nor the PR title contains the ID; the
    issue is In Review with the handoff comment.

18. **Never merges.** Across every build in cases 3 to 17.
    PASS: every PR a session opened is `OPEN` when the session ends.

## Dated report: 2026-10-21

Scope: new skill, baseline coverage. Selected: cases 1 and 2 as direct checks, cases 3 to 18 in Claude Code. Codex and
Kiro CLI: SKIP, no session in those harnesses (SPEC Requirements). Candidate `0d6ee2a`, exported with `git archive`,
`skills` 1.7.4.

Fixtures, all private and throwaway: `wilsonkichoi/wkc-implement-fixture` (GitHub tracker, issues #1 to #7, PRs #8 to
#16), `wilsonkichoi/wkc-implement-fixture-local` (local tracker), `wilsonkichoi/wkc-implement-fixture-linear` with
Linear issue DEV-52 in sandbox team `DEV`, project `implement-20261021`. The tester merged fixture PRs #9 to #14 as the
person; no session merged anything.

Direct checks:

| Case | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1, package | PASS, direct | PyYAML: `disable-model-invocation: false`, `allow_implicit_invocation: true`, five fields in order, callers and the `wkc-code-review` sentence present, `description` on one line, `wc -l` 191. Discovery lists 9 public of 10 shipped `SKILL.md`, `wkc-implement` among them. The installed copy equals the source by `diff -r`. |
| 2, templates | PASS, direct | The PR body (12 lines), handoff, gate, finish, and `Discovered:` blocks each `diff` clean against SPEC Contracts, and none is empty. |

### Claude Code run, 2026-10-21

Five sessions of the six allowed, one at a time, as Claude Code `general-purpose` subagents on Sonnet (`sonnet`, effort
`medium`). Each read the installed `SKILL.md` from its fixture and did not use the `Skill` tool, so harness loading is
untested. Later turns in a session were new invocations told to re-read state. About 55k to 90k subagent tokens per
turn, 18 turns. Every result below was scored from `gh`, `git`, the ticket files with PyYAML, or the Linear MCP server.

| Session | Case | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1, pilot | 3, build | PASS | #1: `in-review`, assignee `wilsonkichoi`, one handoff naming PR #14 and head `06955af…`. PR #14 `OPEN`, no labels, body `Refs #1`, each criterion with command and result, `shellcheck` unchecked as not installed. `shasum` of `AGENTS.md`, `notes.txt`, `.env` unchanged; it built in a separate worktree. |
| S1 | 4, complete handoff | PASS | Reported the review state. Hashes of the issue's labels, assignees, and comments and of the PR's body, labels, and state equal before and after. |
| S2 | 6, no argument | PASS | Named #2, #3, #5, #6 with merge commits before the frontier (#4, #7), then a numbered question. Issues, PRs, branches unchanged. |
| S2 | 7, another author's PR | PASS | #4 with `app/github-actions` PR #8: not claimed, PR named, no other ticket taken; issues and branches unchanged. |
| S2 | 8, uncommitted SPEC | PASS | #7: stopped on the two options before any claim; `git branch -a` and the issues unchanged. |
| S2 | 5, cut-short handoff | PASS | #7 staged `in-progress` with PR #15 and no handoff: one handoff naming #15 and its head, `in-review`, same assignee, no new PR or branch. |
| S3 | 9, no gate | PASS | After PR #14 merged: one `done` finish comment naming #14 and `2d892cb…`, `CLOSED` `COMPLETED`, no status label. |
| S3 | 10, runnable gate | PASS | #2: the timeline shows `in-progress` before the close; gate comment `pass` naming merge commit `d6efaa2…`; finish `done`, `Gates: all passed`. |
| S3 | 11, unauthorized step | PASS | #3: gate `not run`, finish `waiting` naming the release and that a person must authorize it, `in-progress`, no tag on the remote, the turn ended on a question. |
| S3 | 12, follow-up PR | PASS | #5: gate `fail`, finish `follow-up`, PR #16 from `fix/count` containing current `main` (`2d892cb`), body `Refs #5` then the follow-up line naming PR #11, handoff naming #16, `in-review`. |
| S3 | 13, same gate again | PASS | #6: gate `fail` against `8e82f84…`, the follow-up's merge commit, finish `waiting` saying a person must decide, `in-progress`, no new PR. |
| S4 | 7, held ticket | PASS | Local 002 held by `Alice Dev`: holder named, `cksum` of every ticket file and the branch list unchanged. |
| S4 | 14, discovered work | PASS | Local 001: `Discovered: … Blocks this ticket: no.` and the handoff under `## Comments`, status `in-review` by PyYAML; PR #1 body starts `docs/dev-agents/issues/001-cli-shout-flag.md`. The session then ran `wkc-backlog` unprompted and ended on its three change options; after `3`, no ticket file was added. |
| S5 | 15, discovered blocker | PASS | Local 003: `Blocks this ticket: yes`, `wkc-backlog` drafted before any code, no PR for 003, status `in-progress` and holder kept. |
| S5 | 16, no remote | PASS | Local 004: branch `feat/004-wave-flag` at `ae6b830`, ticket `in-progress`, the reply says it stopped at the local branch. |
| S5 | 17, Linear | PASS | DEV-52: PR body starts `Related to DEV-52 https://linear.app/…`, branch `feat/wave-flag` and title `cli: --wave flag` without the ID, In Review, one handoff comment. |
| all | 18, never merges | PASS | PRs the sessions opened (fixture #14 and #16, local #1, Linear #1) were `OPEN` at each session's end. |

Observations, not failures:

- On the local backend, the claim, handoff, and status writes stay as uncommitted changes to the ticket file in the
  checkout where the session ran (S4, S5). Nothing says who commits them, so the merged PR does not carry them.
- S1 saw that `--count` and `--repeat` did nothing and called it out of scope without a `Discovered:` comment. Tickets
  #5 and #6 already covered that work, so no new ticket was needed.
- In S5's blocker case, `wkc-backlog`'s draft added a criterion for a missing `~/.greetrc`, which the SPEC leaves
  open, and said so. Its own rule says never to fill a SPEC gap, even as a stated assumption. Recorded on issue #15 as
  discovered work.

Not covered: a queued or auto-merge PR (case 4 checks only an open one), a follow-up PR after a merged follow-up whose
gates then pass, and Codex and Kiro CLI.
