# wkc-help

- **What it does:** answers questions about the `wkc-` skills from `wilsonkichoi/skills`, and gives
  or runs the installer commands that manage them.
- **When to use it:** any question about these skills or their installation. Callers are people and
  models. A model may answer on its own, but runs a command that changes files only when a person
  asked for that change.
- **Dependencies:** the installed `wkc-` skills. Node.js, npm, and Git to run installer commands.
  `gh` is optional, for release lookups.
- **Input:** a question in plain words. With no question, give a short overview of the installed
  skills and how to update them.
- **Output:** an answer with the exact commands, or the result of commands the person asked you to run.

## 1. Questions about a skill

The installed skills sit in sibling directories next to this one. Read the `SKILL.md` of the skill
in question and answer from it, not from memory. When showing how to call a skill, use the syntax of
the harness you are running in. When a skill is not installed, say so and show how to add it.

## 2. Installation

Commands use the `skills` installer through `npx skills`. `-a` names the harnesses;
`claude-code`, `codex`, and `kiro-cli` are the tested ones. Use the ones the person names, or the
ones the project already has. Never pass `-a '*'` or `--all`: they install into every agent the
installer knows, turn copies into links, and replace a top-level `skills/` directory with links,
deleting the source in it.

Install every public skill, either from the default branch or from a release tag:

```
npx skills add wilsonkichoi/skills -s '*' -a claude-code -a codex -a kiro-cli -y
npx skills add 'https://github.com/wilsonkichoi/skills.git#vX.Y.Z' -s '*' -a claude-code -a codex -a kiro-cli -y
```

A tag needs the full git URL, quoted, because `#` starts a shell comment. Replace `-s '*'` with
`-s <name> ...` for some skills only. `'*'` leaves out the internal `wkc-skills-release`, which
installs only by exact name. By default each harness links to one copy in `.agents/skills/`;
`--copy` gives each harness its own copy instead.

The latest release is at https://github.com/wilsonkichoi/skills/releases/latest, or
`gh release view --repo wilsonkichoi/skills`. Add a tag to that command to read one release's notes.

## 3. Versions and updates

Each skill's `ref` in `skills-lock.json` at the project root is the tag or branch it was installed
from. No `ref` means the default branch; the lock does not record which commit. A tag or branch here
belongs to `wilsonkichoi/skills`, not to the person's project; never change the project's Git branch.

`npx skills update -p` refetches each installed skill from its recorded `ref`. An unpinned
install gets the newest default branch. A tag-pinned install stays where it is, because tags never
move. To change releases, rerun `add` with the new tag, the same skills and harnesses, and `--copy`
if it was used before. `update` refreshes only skills already in the lock; add new ones by name.

The lock records neither harnesses nor mode, and `npx skills ls` lists every agent that can read
`.agents/skills/`, not the ones installed. The installed harnesses are the project's harness skill
folders that hold the skill. A real directory there, rather than a link into `.agents/skills/`, is
a `--copy` install. `add` skips a skill name the tag does not contain, with no message and exit 0,
so check the tag first with `npx skills add '<url>#<tag>' -l`.

## 4. Removal

```
npx skills remove wkc-setup wkc-tracker -a claude-code -a codex -a kiro-cli
```

Always name the skills and the harnesses. Never run `remove --all`, or `remove` without `-a`, in a
repository with its own top-level `skills/` directory: the installer treats a bare `skills/` as
OpenClaw's project path and deletes it. A full uninstall also deletes `docs/dev-agents/`, which
`wkc-setup` wrote, and its reference line in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`.

## 5. Running commands

Show the exact command first. Run it only when the person asks you to. Afterwards, read the
installer's output, `skills-lock.json`, and the installed directories, and report what changed. The
installer can print a failure and still exit 0, so a zero exit alone does not mean success.
